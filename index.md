# Welcome

I'm fortunate to have grown from the ground up in the field of software engineering and information systems. 

This field has transformed from siloed, rules-based, relatively data-sparse systems in the late 1990s and early 2000s into heavily interconnected, data consuming and data-generating systems. 

Arguably more important than an organization's physical products are those data that define their products, operations, customers, suppliers, schedules, customers, devices, and finances. 

My career has evolved from the first generation of high-traffic web applications, serving millions of consumers daily, to today's tools for analyzing, engineering, channeling, managing, and deriving value from large and continually evolving datasets. These datasets range from consumers' on-system activities to specialized financial or accounting instruments. 

The field of information systems will continue to evolve from "pipelines, databases, applications, and reports" to more agile and autonomous data-driven systems. Many decisions currently made by analysts and developers will be driven by AI/ML models, leading to self-managing and self-reporting information systems. 

Software features, or management reports previously handcrafted from an analyst's analysis of persistent data stores and passed over to a software developer will be generated from large language models tied into the information systems of an enterprise. 

I bring domain knowledge of business systems analysis and design, software engineering, and data science.
